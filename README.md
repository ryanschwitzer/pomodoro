# Pomodoro - Tick-Tock, Let's Get Stuff Done! (and take breaks!)

Just a little something I created to stay on track and maintain a good work and break balance: it helps avoid burnout for me. It's a simple Pomodoro timer with a GUI, so no more staring blankly at a command line wondering if it's break time yet.

Basically, it helps you do the whole work-in-focused-chunks thing with little breathers in between. Think of it as your friendly digital nudge to stay productive without burning out.

I also got to play around with Tkinter and make a proper window pop up, which was pretty cool! VERY MINIMAL GUI, but it was a fun to dive into GUI basics.
